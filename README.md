# PPL-Project1-Lettuce-Language

This project explores compiling arithmetic expressions with let-bindings into stack machine bytecode.
Here an emulator is implemented to execute the complied bytecode. This code was completed using standalone Scala, 
the IntelliJ IDE and sbt (Scala Build Tools). This is an assignment from the CSCI 3155 Principles of Programming
Languages course and the language is further extended in the following repository [PPL-Project2-Lettuce-Language-Extended](https://github.com/JoaquinQuintana/PPL-Project2-Lettuce-Language-Extended)
